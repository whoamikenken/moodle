        The question backup API has been improved to only include questions that
        are actually used or owned by backed up activities.

        Any activities that use question references should be supported
        automatically. Activities that use *question set references* (for
        example, random quiz questions) need to add a call to
        `backup_question_set_reference_trait::annotate_set_reference_bank_entries()`
        alongside the call to
        `backup_question_set_reference_trait::add_question_set_references()` in
        their backup step. See
        `backup_quiz_activity_structure_step::define_structure()` for an
        example.
