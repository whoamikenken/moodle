notes:
  core_question:
    - message: >-
        `question_edit_contexts` now only considers the provided context when
        checking permissions, rather than all parent contexts as well. As
        questions now exist only at the activity module context level,
        permissions can be inherited or overridden as normal for each question
        bank. The previous pattern of checking for a permission in any parent
        context circumvented the override system, and no longer makes sense.
