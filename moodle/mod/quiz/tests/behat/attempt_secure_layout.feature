  @javascript
  Scenario: Large user image in the quiz navigation in secure layout
    Given I am on the "Quiz 1" "mod_quiz > View" page logged in as "student"
    And I press "Attempt quiz"
    And I switch to a second window
    Then "Student One" "link" should not exist in the "Quiz navigation" "block"

  Scenario: A quiz page on the secure layout shows both the course name and the quiz name
    Given I am on the "Quiz 1" "mod_quiz > View" page logged in as "student"
    When I press "Attempt quiz"
    Then I should see "Course 1"
    And I should see "Quiz 1"
    And I should see "Quiz 1 description"
